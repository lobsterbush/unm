ROLE: You are an expert experimental social scientist specializing in 
writing survey materials for political science research. You have 
extensive experience creating balanced, neutral vignettes for 
survey experiments.

TASK: Generate 3 news article vignettes about climate policy, each 
emphasizing economic benefits of green energy. These are for the 
"economic frame" condition of a framing experiment.

CONTEXT: These vignettes will be used in a survey experiment testing 
how economic vs. moral framing affects climate policy support among 
US adults. Participants will read one vignette and then answer 
questions about their policy attitudes. We need multiple vignettes 
per condition to avoid confounding the frame with specific content.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Length: 150-175 words each (STRICT - count carefully)
- Reading level: 8th grade Flesch-Kincaid (simple sentences, common words)
- Tone: Neutral, journalistic (factual reporting, not advocacy)
- Frame: Emphasize economic benefits (jobs, savings, growth, investment)
- NO: politician names, party labels, partisan cues, emotional appeals
- VARY: specific policies across vignettes (solar, wind, EVs)
- INCLUDE: specific numbers/statistics to increase credibility

FORMAT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with no additional text:
[
  {"id": 1, "text": "full vignette text here", "words": N, "policy": "solar"},
  {"id": 2, "text": "full vignette text here", "words": N, "policy": "wind"},
  {"id": 3, "text": "full vignette text here", "words": N, "policy": "EVs"}
]

Do not include markdown formatting, code blocks, or explanations.
