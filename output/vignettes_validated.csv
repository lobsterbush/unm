1,"A recent report highlights the economic benefits of investing in solar energy. The study shows that expanding solar power could create over 500,000 new jobs by 2025. These jobs will range from manufacturing solar panels to installing them on homes and businesses. Additionally, the report indicates that households could save an average of $1,200 a year on energy bills by switching to solar. With solar energy becoming more affordable, the potential for growth in this sector is significant. Experts estimate that investments in solar technology could generate $100 billion in economic activity over the next decade. This shift towards renewable energy not only helps the environment but also offers substantial financial returns for both individuals and communities. As more people adopt solar energy, the economy stands to benefit greatly.",157,solar,131,-26,FALSE,FALSE,12.774875954198475,32.63880248091607,FALSE,13,8,1.625,TRUE
2,"A new analysis reveals that increasing investment in wind energy could have major economic advantages. According to the report, the wind energy sector is projected to create around 300,000 jobs by 2030. These jobs include roles in turbine manufacturing, maintenance, and operations. Furthermore, wind energy can provide significant savings on electricity costs. Households could see reductions of up to $600 annually. The study also notes that every dollar invested in wind energy can generate approximately $1.50 in economic output. This means that as the demand for wind energy rises, communities can experience growth and new business opportunities. The transition to wind power not only supports clean energy goals but also strengthens local economies.",158,wind,115,-43,FALSE,FALSE,12.487554347826087,31.136548913043526,FALSE,12,8,1.5,TRUE
3,"A recent study emphasizes the economic impact of electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the United States. By 2030, the transition to EVs could create about 1.2 million jobs in manufacturing, sales, and maintenance. These jobs will be essential as more Americans switch to electric vehicles. The report also highlights potential savings for consumers, estimating that EV owners can save around $800 annually on fuel and maintenance costs. In addition, for every $1 billion spent on EV infrastructure, approximately 17,000 jobs could be generated in construction and related fields. As the market for electric vehicles expands, the overall economic growth from this sector can lead to increased investment and innovation. This shift not only promotes sustainable transportation but also contributes to job creation and economic stability.",162,EVs,127,-35,FALSE,FALSE,13.784926884139484,28.54598425196852,FALSE,9,7,1.2857142857142858,TRUE
